I made it so the post thing was more like an actuall social media post layout. if i ever add pictures to posts that will work too. I was just kind of thinking about cool things I could do with the site like get an email list so that if you want an email every time i posted somthing then you could get it. I also will probably add another page where i write more in depth articles about things that are too long to just go in posts. I also plan to make tutorials for multiple different things so look forward to that. I also open sourced a school project that i did. It is a sudoku programm written in C++ that I am actually very proud of it. I have lots of cool ideas for things i can do with the web site.
